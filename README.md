This tracks my experimental modifications to EIGENSOFT 5; if I break something, a binary search through my commit history will hopefully allow my mistake to be identified without too much pain.

Note that, while OS X is not formally supported, in practice I use a Mac for most of my development work so any code here should work on both OS X and Linux.  And, while Windows is *really* not supported, if there is sufficient interest, I think I can produce working Windows binaries on an intermittent basis.
