This tracks my experimental modifications to EIGENSOFT 5; if I break something, a binary search through my commit history will hopefully allow my mistake to be identified without too much pain.

It includes the dumpgrmbin() bugfix in 5.0.1, as well as the corresponding text GRM fix.

Note that, while OS X is not formally supported, in practice I use a Mac for most of my development work so any code here should work on both OS X and Linux.  And, while Windows is *really* not supported, you can nevertheless find (possibly old) working Windows binaries in the win32/ and win64/ directories.
